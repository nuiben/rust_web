# Rust Web Development

Hybrid repository for full-stack development. Experimenting with Rust GUI libraries, Rust APIs, and Web Tools.

## Rust API

No venture into web development is complete without launching your first API. The project which this forks from can be found [here](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/rust/rust-mongodb-crud-tutorial/#creating-your-database) with credit to Jorge and Mark.

The API downloads the mongodb crate to the Rustup toolkit for the purpose of establishing a connection to the database and utilizes the [tokio crate](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/) to support asynchronous tasks. The list of dependencies is large and far surpasses the scope of this initial project.
